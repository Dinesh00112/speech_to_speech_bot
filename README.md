# Speech to Speech Bot

This research presents the development of a speech-to-speech Large Language Model (LLM) bot utilizing Google's PaLM pre-trained model. 
The bot is designed to engage in natural language conversations, converting spoken input into text, processing it using the PaLM model, and generating a suitable spoken response. 
The PaLM model's ability to understand and generate human-like text is leveraged to create a more conversational and engaging user experience. 
This work explores the potential of LLMs in speech-based interactions, highlighting the advancements in natural language processing and their applications in various domains.
